# String in Python is any number,word,letter or special character that is written in enclosed single or double inverted commas
String = "17"
string = 17
# Here the variable String has the value "17" stored in it whereas the variable string has the value 17 in it
#initially it looks the same but the value "17" is string and the value 17 is int
print(type(String))
print(type(string))
# We will get the output as follows:
# <class 'str'> for the value of variable String which is "17"
# <class 'int'> for the value of variable string which is 17
# String is extremely essential in Python as they lie at the core of Python programming language
