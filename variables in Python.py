''' Variables are memory operators who hold a specific value in a program, either from the beginning or later by the user'''
a = 5
b = 10
''' Here a and b are variables who are assigned with the values 5 and 10 respectively'''
c = int(input("Enter a number:"))
'here c is a variable but unlike a and b,its value is not preassigned and has to be assigned by the user'
